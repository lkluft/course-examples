# This function generates prime numbers up to a user specified maximum `N`.
# The algorithm used is the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
# It is quite simple. Given an array of integers from 1 to `N`, cross out all multiples
# of 2. Find the next uncrossed integer, and cross out all of its multiples.
# Repeat until you have passed the square root of `N`.
# The uncrossed numbers that remain are all the primes less than `N`.

# quick notice: this is a verbatic port of a Java code to Python,
# and as such it is unreasonably low level.
